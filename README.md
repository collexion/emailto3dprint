## The Plan

Build a pipeline that receives emails addressed to builder@collexion.net that have attached .stl files and prints them on a Makerbot Replicator2. The goal is minimal human involvement. Knowing the build platform is clear, and prompting pieces to be collected as a build completes are important. See also: [octoprint](http://octoprint.org/).
